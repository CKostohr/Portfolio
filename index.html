  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I started computer programming because of cryptocurrency. Then that lead to networking. I have enjoyed SQL and IT. When Iâ€™m not trying to learn new ways of computer programming, I enjoy hiking with my wife of 14 years. I love all things outdoors. Camping tops that list. I have two children of my own and adopted two; they are all boys, ages 6, 8, 12, and 14. </p>
